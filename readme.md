# 01 - Reinforcing Exercises

These short exercises will give you a chance to practice the fundamental programming concepts you've learned so far.
## Prerequisites

+ programming fundamentals

## Exercise

Write a function that accepts a number as an argument and returns a string containing that number along with its *"ordinal indicator"*. E.g. passing in `1` would return `"1st"`, `2` would return `"2nd"`, `3` would return `"3rd"`, `4` would return `"4th"`, etc.

Make sure your function works for every number between 1 and 20. If you're feeling ambitious, see if you can get it working for numbers beyond that.
